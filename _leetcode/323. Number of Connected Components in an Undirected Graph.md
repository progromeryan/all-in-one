## Problem

Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to find the number of connected components in an undirected graph.

Example 1:

```
Input: n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]]

     0          3
     |          |
     1 --- 2    4

Output: 2
```

Example 2:

```
Input: n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]

     0           4
     |           |
     1 --- 2 --- 3

Output:  1
```

Note:
You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.

## Code

union find

```java
class Solution {
    // 所以查找的时候都会往一个方向走, 直到找到同一个节点
    private int find(int[] roots, int i) {
        while(roots[i] != -1){
            i = roots[i];
        }

        return i;
    }

    public int countComponents(int n, int[][] edges) {
        int res = n;

        int[] roots = new int[n];

        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            roots[i] = -1;
        }

        for(int[] pair : edges){
            int x = find(roots, pair[0]);
            int y = find(roots, pair[1]);

            if(x != y){
                roots[x] = y;
                res--;
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```
