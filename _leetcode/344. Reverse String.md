## Problem

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

Example 1:

```
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = s.length - 1;

        while(left < right) {
            char c = s[left];
            s[left] = s[right];
            s[right] = c;
            left++;
            right--;
        }
    }
}
```
