## Problem

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence (i.e. subarray). The subsequence must be strictly increasing.

A continuous increasing subsequence is defined by two indices l and r (l < r) such that it is [nums[l], nums[l + 1], ..., nums[r - 1], nums[r]] and for each l <= i < r, nums[i] < nums[i + 1].



Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5] with length 3.
Even though [1,3,5,7] is an increasing subsequence, it is not continuous as elements 5 and 7 are separated by element
4.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2] with length 1. Note that it must be strictly
increasing.
```
## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int findLengthOfLCIS(int[] nums) {
        int maxLen = 1;
        int currLen = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
                currLen++;
                maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, currLen);
            } else {
                currLen = 1;
            }
        }

        return maxLen;
    }
}
```
