## Problem

Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.

As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
Note: This question is the same as 538: https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-bst-to-greater-tree/

Example 1:

```
Input: root = [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: root = [0,null,1]
Output: [1,null,1]
```

Example 3:

```
Input: root = [1,0,2]
Output: [3,3,2]
```

Example 4:

```
Input: root = [3,2,4,1]
Output: [7,9,4,10]
```

## Code

重复: 与 538 一样

```java
class Solution {
    int sum = 0;
    public TreeNode bstToGst(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) return root;
        bstToGst(root.right);
        sum += root.val;
        root.val = sum;
        bstToGst(root.left);
        return root;
    }
}
```
